# crashguard
Spawns a process and respawns on crash. Quite simple.

# Usage
(1) Install node.js   
(2) crashguard.js [process and arguments]

# Conf file
Alternatively multiple processes can be specified via the `conf/process.json` file. 

See `conf/process.json.example` for an example and rename it as `process.json`.

If conf file is used, then command line arguments are ignored.
